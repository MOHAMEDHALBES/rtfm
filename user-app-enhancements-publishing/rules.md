# Rules of user-submitted app enhancements publishing


## Metadata requirements

Before setting app enhancement to public, make sure that:

1. It successfully combines with compatible app(s) when installed via appdb.
2. It has an icon. If icon was not parsed by appdb automatically, please [create ticket in support desk](https://aysa-support.freshdesk.com/), so we can diagnose this issue.
3. You have provided description of enhancement, what's new and added screenshots.
4. You have filled in app enhancement source (it may be your name).
5. All other fields like developer and license text are filled, if you know what they should be.

General rule - the more metadata you can provide, the better it is.

## Don'ts

There are also some **don'ts** that you should take into an account.

**Do not make an app enhancement public** if at least one of these statements are true:


1. License of an app enhancement itself from developer forbids it to be published on appdb.
2. Enhancement is modifying app behavior in the way which prevent app developer from directly benefiting on it (e.g. paid functions inside are provided for free due to injected enhancement).
3. App enhancement modifies an app to become malicious app.
4. App enhancement significantly degrades user experience with original app. 

## Other considerable topics

1. Do not use the word "Tweak", use the word "Enhancement".
2. If app enhancement adds paid content and beneficiary is app enhancement developer, make sure that you mention that appdb **and app developer** does not take any responsibility for functionality of added/enhanced aspects of the app.

## Violations

appdb staff periodically and randomly checks app enhancements that were provided by users. Copyright owners may also submit complaint against content that was published by you, or your app enhancement may be superseded by an officially published app enhancement on appdb.

In case of detection of violation of these rules, this will happen:

1. appdb sends you a notice of violation detection.
2. You have 24 hours to fix an issue, by negotiating with copyright owner or/and appdb; or remove your app enhancement from public access.
3. If you haven't reacted in 24 hours, appdb automatically removes your app enhancement from public access.

In case of multiple violations of these rules, app enhancement publication ability may be revoked from you permanently.
