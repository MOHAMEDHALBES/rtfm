# Logs submission to appdb

If apps [installation troubleshooting manual](/troubleshooting/app-installations.md) did not help you, we ask you to provide logs. And here is how to do it without PC or Mac.

1. Remove grey app icon, or icon with cloud if any.
2. Clear command queue on your device from [device status page](https://appdb.to/my/status).
3. Go back to app page on appdb.
4. Trigger app installation with Install button.
5. Wait till popup appears, accept installation, wait till error.
6. Immediately after error trigger iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/visionOS/watchOS to gather diagnostic information (please check attached PDFs of how to trigger it). It will take about 10 minutes.
7. Go to your device logs on your device (Settings.app > Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data), find file "sysdiagnose" and then don't airdrop them to Mac or PC, just upload it somewhere. **You don't need Mac or PC**.
8. Provide link to log archive to support desk.
