# How to publish an app from your personal library

**If you are developer of an app and want to publish your app on appdb officially, please refer to [this manual](/#).**

If you are using appdb to install apps from [your personal app library](https://appdb.to/my/apps), you may also share app that you found on internet with other users on appdb.

**Publicly shared apps are not taking space in your personal app library.**

To publish your app, you need to make sure that it comply with [Rules of user-submitted app publishing](/user-app-publishing/rules.md) and make it public. To do this, tap on "edit metadata".

A visual editor will open. Fill in required information (or fill it from another publicly available app or/and version) and don't forget to set app as public:

Then, tap **Save Changes**. If some metadata is missing, appdb will highlight field that needs to be filled.

Once changes are saved, you will be redirected to public page of your shared app.

You can also check that your shared app is available in [Index](https://appdb.to/index).
