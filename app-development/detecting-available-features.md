# Detection of available app features

We do our best in order to support [all our services and features](/services-and-features/overview) in all officially released apps, but due to lack of interoperability at the moment and [Various supported app installation methods](https://appdb.to/my/buy), not all services may be supported by the installed app.

To get an array of supported services, invoke ```getSupportedServicesIdentifiers``` methods of [appdb services SDK](https://github.com/appdb-official/AppdbSDK).
