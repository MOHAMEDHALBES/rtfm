# Rules of user-submitted app publishing


## Metadata requirements

Before setting app to public, make sure that:

1. It is installable. Tap install button and check that it is installed on your device.
2. Compatibility with various operating systems is detected and filled correctly. If it was not parsed by appdb automatically, please [create ticket in support desk](https://aysa-support.freshdesk.com/), so we can diagnose this issue.
3. It has an icon. If icon was not parsed by appdb automatically, please [create ticket in support desk](https://aysa-support.freshdesk.com/), so we can diagnose this issue.
4. You have provided description, what's new and added screenshots.
5. You have filled in app source (it may be your name).
6. All other fields like developer and license text are filled, if you know what they should be.

General rule - the more metadata you can provide, the better it is.

## Don'ts

There are also some **don'ts** that you should take into an account.

**Do not make an app public** if at least one of these statements are true:


1. License of an app from developer forbids it to be published on appdb.
2. App contains an enhancements that modify app behavior in the way which prevent app developer from directly benefiting on it (e.g. paid functions inside are provided for free due to injected enhancement).
3. App contains any malicious functionality.
4. App distribution requires special license by the government.
5. App contains any references to drugs, sexual abuse, easy-to-get-rich and other activity that is not authorized in the regulatory sense in European Union countries.
6. App involves access to an accounts of financial institutions (e.g. banking app).

## Other considerable topics

1. Do not use the word "Tweaked", if app was enhanced, use the word "Enhanced" or "Enhancement".
2. Do not advertise anything in apps description.
3. If app contains in-app purchases, make sure that you mention that appdb does not take any responsibility for payments and services inside this app.

## Violations

appdb staff periodically and randomly checks apps that were provided by users. Copyright owners may also submit complaint against content that was published by you, or your app may be superseded by an officially published app on appdb.

In case of detection of violation of these rules, this will happen:

1. appdb sends you a notice of violation detection.
2. You have 24 hours to fix an issue, by negotiating with copyright owner or/and appdb; or remove your app from public access.
3. If you haven't reacted in 24 hours, appdb automatically removes your app from public access.

In case of multiple violations of these rules, app publication ability may be revoked from you permanently.
